# E4PSolutions

 This repo is to collect and monitor the progress and completion of the Exercises for Programmers.
Each challenge is to help me improve my progamming skills as well as give me a starter kit for my
first repo with github. More importantly it is a way to share my work with others in the community
in order to improve the code for each challenge and provide feedback that can help me or any one
else who is lloking to improve their programming skills.
